    <h3 class="CV-1">Aircraft Cariers</h3>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Let's start with the Aircraft Carriers. The first thing to know about
        this class is they requier a basic skill that is Target prioritization.
        The reason for this is because when you play Aircraft Cariers AKA CV's
        you are going to encounter a thing known as AA anti aricraft fire. Which
        will cause damage to your aircraft which are you main armament used in
        attacking surface combatants. The skill Target Prioritization comes in
        handy because when you look at the mini map wich will give you all the
        information required in choosing which ships to go after. Things to
        consider when choosing a target are how many ships are located near your
        intended target? you don't want to attack several ships becasue the AA
        will be much stronger and harder to get an attack through. So I recomend
        when the Game starts you launch your strik aircraft which will be the
        Rocket planes and fly around the map and spot both the left and right
        flanks. This will then give you the information neccesary to determine
        what flank is most viable to attack (whichever flank has the least
        amount of ships.) Another crusial skill when playing a cv is knowing
        where to position your vessel. There are a few factors wich determine a
        good position for a cv such as 1 getting close to the battlefeild
        without being detecting the best way to do this is to sail your ship
        upto an island while staing behind it to hide you ship from being
        detected.

    <h3 class="BB-1">Battleships</h3>
    <p>
      Battleships are the heavy armourd warships that take the fight to the
      enemy in world of warships and use there armour to tank damage for the
      team.
